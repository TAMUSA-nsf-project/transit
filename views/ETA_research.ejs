                   <p> Providing accurate, real-time bus location information reduces ridersâ€™ wait times and thus the length of
                    their daily commutes, leaving more time for vocational, educational, and leisure activities. Our SmartSAT
                    mobile web app will track bus location using a combination of Google APIs, Google Live Transit Updates
                    service, and bus Global Positioning System (GPS) to improve the prediction accuracy of bus arrival time.

                            <h5>Proposed Work</h5>                  
                            <p>Existing approaches use GPS to collect real time location information of a vehicle to
                                predict public transport arrival times on bus stops. However, the evaluation of the proposed algorithm
                                shows errors in predicted times. In addition, issues related to GPS outages and location errors have not
                                been addressed. To address such issues, other approaches used the historical and real time location data to
                                determine the current location of a bus and to predict arrival time at a bus-stop. Results,
                                however, show mean error of 5 minutes in the arrival time prediction. To improve the arrival time
                                accuracy, we will use information provided by Direction API and Distance Matrix API of Google Maps,
                                Google's Live Transit Updates service, and Bus GPS to calculate bus travel times based on real-time
                                traffic data to obtain accurate real-time traffic data, compute travel times and predict the arrival time at a
                                bus-stop. Data analytics will then be used to assess the accuracy of the predicted arrival time by comparing
                                it with the actual bus arrival time. The study will also assess the accuracy of the current scheduled time by
                                comparing it with the actual bus arrival time. </p>

                    <h5>Methodology</h5>
                            <p> The primary outcome measure that will be used to evaluate our hypothesis is the arrival
                                time prediction error (i.e., the difference between the actual and predicted bus arrival times). The outcome
                                will be evaluated using multiple-trip data collected over the six VIA bus routes selected for this
                                project. We will measure the mean error (difference in time) between the actual arrival time and the
                                predicted one. Results will show the accuracy of predicted times, and whether this accuracy can be
                                improved. If the accuracy is improved, we will determine the accuracy of the scheduled times and if they
                                need to be changed.
